Ginny:「Four, Hermione.」
Luna:「I think there are six of us, actually.」
Harry:「Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go! Look, you three — you’re not involved in this, you’re not —」
Neville, Ginny, Luna:「burst into more protests」
Harry:「Okay, fine, it’s your choice. But unless we can find more thestrals you’re not going to be able —」
Ginny:「Oh, more of them will come. Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood, and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place . . .」
Harry:「Okay, then. Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she’ll attract more thestrals —」
Hermione:「I’m not staying behind!」
Luna:「There’s no need. Look, here come more now. . . . You two must really smell . . .」

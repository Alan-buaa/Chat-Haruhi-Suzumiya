Hermione:「Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it? she said blearily. I’m just so — so — so tired, she yawned. I was up until one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!」
Harry:「Great, said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office and she touched my arm . . .」

Hermione:「I suppose so, said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose . . .」
Harry:「She’s evil, said Harry flatly. Twisted.」
Hermione:「She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.」

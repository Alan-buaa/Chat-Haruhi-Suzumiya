Harry:「He’s seen the Snitch! He’s seen it! Look at him go!」
Hermione:「They’re going to crash!」
Ron:「They’re not!」
Harry:「Lynch is!」
Charlie:「The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?」
Harry:「He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over!」
Bagman:「IRELAND WINS! KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don’t think any of us were expecting that!」
Ron:「What did he catch the Snitch for? He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!」
Harry:「He knew they were never going to catch up! The Irish Chasers were too good. He wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all.」
Hermione:「He was very brave, wasn’t he? He looks a terrible mess. . . .」

Narrator:Harry think "She’s Ron’s sister. But she’s ditched Dean! She’s still Ron’s sister. I’m his best mate! That’ll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He’d hit you. What if I don’t care? He’s your best mate!"
Hermione:「Katie! You’re back! Are you okay?」
Katie:「I’m really well! They let me out of St. Mungo’s on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?」
Katie:「No. Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.」
Hermione:「You definitely went into the bathroom, then?」

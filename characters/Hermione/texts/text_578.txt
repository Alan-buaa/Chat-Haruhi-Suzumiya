Harry:「I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.」
Hermione:「That would be a complete waste of potion. Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .」

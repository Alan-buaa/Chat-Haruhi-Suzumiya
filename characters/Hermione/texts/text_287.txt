Narrator:Harry think "Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx."
Hermione:「You’re still doing really well, though. Some of these are bound to come in handy.」
Ron:「Come and look at this. What’s Malfoy doing?」
Harry:「He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie.」
Hermione:「He can’t be, I’ve told you, those sorts of things don’t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry, let’s try that Shield Charm again.」

Harry:「They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake.」
Hermione:「He’s not out, is he?」
Ron:「There’s a weird noise. Listen — is that Fang?」
Harry:「Think we’d better go and get someone?」
Harry:「Hagrid! Hagrid, are you in there?」
Hagrid:「Yeh’ve heard?」
Harry:「Hagrid, what is it?」
Harry:「What’s this, Hagrid?」
Ron:「Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!」
Hagrid:「Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures! They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!」
Hagrid:「I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow! All on his own! At Christmas.」
Hermione:「You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid. I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.」

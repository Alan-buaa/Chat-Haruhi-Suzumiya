Ron:「Well, you do, but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .」
Hermione:「It’s pathetic.」
Ginny:「You don’t really want her around forever?」
Ron:「Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.」
Harry:「How’s she going to manage that?」
Ginny:「She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.」
Ron:「Yeah, that’ll work.」
Ron:「Listen, no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but —」
Ginny:「She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm.」
Hermione:「And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!」

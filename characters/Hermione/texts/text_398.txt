Hermione:「And you found them?」
Hagrid:「Well, they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest. Pretty big, see.」
Ron:「Where are they?」
Hagrid:「Mountains.」
Hagrid:「They do. O’ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin’ accidents, aren’ they?」
Ron:「Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you’ve been up to! Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors —」
Hagrid:「Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?」
Hermione:「Didn’t you know?」
Hagrid:「WHAT?」
Harry:「— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.」
Hagrid:「You were expelled?」
Harry:「Tell us about your summer and I’ll tell you about mine.」
Hermione:「Madame Maxime went with you, then?」
Hagrid:「I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty.」
Hermione:「Is that all?」

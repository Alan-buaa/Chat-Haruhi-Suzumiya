Harry:「I can’t come, Professor, I’ve got a detention with Professor Snape.」
Slughorn:「Oh dear, dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!」
Harry:「He’s got no chance of persuading Snape, This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.」
Hermione:「I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!」

Narrator:Harry think "Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee."
Fleur Delacour:「“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit into my dress robes!”」
Hermione:「“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall. “She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”」
Ron:「“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.」
Malfoy:「“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them. “You’re not telling me someone’s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?”」
Hermione:「“Hello, Professor Moody!”」
Hermione:「“Well, they’re different . . . I’ve just noticed. . . .”」

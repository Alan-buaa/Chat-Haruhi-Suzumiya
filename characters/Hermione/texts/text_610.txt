Harry:「Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?」
Scrimgeour:「No idea, For the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and whatever it was.」
Scrimgeour:「You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?」
Harry:「I suppose so, What else could it be?」
Scrimgeour:「I’m asking the questions, I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch, Why is that?」
Hermione:「Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious, There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!」

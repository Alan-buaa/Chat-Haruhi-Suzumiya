Sirius:「It’s possible,」
Hermione:「Winky didn’t steal that wand!」
Sirius:「The elf wasn’t the only one in that box, Who else was sitting behind you?」
Harry:「Loads of people, Some Bulgarian ministers . . . Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .」
Ron:「The Malfoys! I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!」
Sirius:「Anyone else?」
Harry:「No one,」
Sirius:「Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,」
Hermione:「I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps, What’s he like?」
Hermione:「We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared, Remember?」
Ron:「Come off it, Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?」
Hermione:「It’s more likely he did it than Winky,」
Hermione:「When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do?」

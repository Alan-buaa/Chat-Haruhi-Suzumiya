Ron:「D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?」
Hermione:「It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.」
Ron:「This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me. What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?」
Hermione:「It wears off after a while. But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.」
Ron:「Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that. They’d have to be really thick. . . .」
Hermione:「Moste Potente Potions? I was wondering if I could keep it.」

Hermione:「We don’t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last. . . .」

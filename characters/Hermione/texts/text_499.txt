Ron:「She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately. Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.」
Hermione:「That’s not fair. She still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!」
Harry:「Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other! Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met —」
Hermione:「That’s not the point. She thinks it was her fault he died!」
Ron:「That’s stupid.」
Hermione:「It’s survivor’s guilt. I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. She’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!」
Hermione:「Nor did I, but I suppose if you’re really depressed . . .」

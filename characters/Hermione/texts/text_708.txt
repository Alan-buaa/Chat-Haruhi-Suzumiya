Narrator:Harry think "Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding; Voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. . . .So close . . . So close . . . With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior. Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of Greyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione. “Don’t touch it!” Harry yelled; he could not stop himself; he thought he might be sick from the pain of it. “I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback. “I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. “There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait —” And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. “It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!” They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices — — Time to fly . . ."
Hermione:「“It isn’t! It isn’t me!” Hermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession. “‘ . . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’” repeated Greyback quietly.」

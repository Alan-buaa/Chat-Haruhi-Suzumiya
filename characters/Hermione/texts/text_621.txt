Harry:「“The others — everyone at the wedding —”」
Hermione:「We can’t worry about that now, It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.」
Ron:「She’s right, Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.」
Harry:「Yeah.」
Hermione:「Come on, I think we ought to keep moving.」
Ron:「True, but don’t you feel a bit — exposed?」
Hermione:「Where else is there? We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’ house, though I think there’s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!」
Ron:「You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross —」
Hermione:「Ron, we can’t!」

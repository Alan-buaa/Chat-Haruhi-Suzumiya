Narrator:Lupin think "Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces. Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice."
Hermione:「It’s a shape-shifter. It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.」

Harry:「The Prophet’s got it right. That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said, it looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.」

Hermione:「I squeezed it and it — it punched me!」
Ron:「Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries —」
Hermione:「Harry, oh, Harry . . . We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh, Harry . . . Are you scared?」
Hermione:「I wonder what he’ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably . . . powerful countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . .」
Hermione:「I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!」

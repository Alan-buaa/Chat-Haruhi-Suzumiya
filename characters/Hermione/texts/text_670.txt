Narrator:Harry think "Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the square."
Hermione:「“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione.」
:Harry
:He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.
Hermione:「I’m sure it is, They . . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.」
Hermione:「pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.」

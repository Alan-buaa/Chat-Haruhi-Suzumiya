Narrator:Harry think "They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived."
Professor McGonagall:「“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.”」
Professor Flitwick:「Professor Flitwick let out a squeal.」
Professor Sprout:「Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth.」
Snape:「Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be sure?”」
Professor McGonagall:「“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, “left another message. Right underneath the first one. ‘Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.’”」
Professor McGonagall:「“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall.」

Professor McGonagall:「He jumped, You mean he’s dead?」
Harry:「What’ve you done to him?」
Professor McGonagall:「No, he’s not dead, Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.」
Harry:「Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!」
Professor McGonagall:「Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming, Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.」

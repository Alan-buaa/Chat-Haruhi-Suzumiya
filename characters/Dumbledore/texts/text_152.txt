Dumbledore:「Enter」
Dumbledore:「there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more to be said —」
Professor Trelawney:「If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. . . .」
Harry:「Please close the door and sit down, Harry」
Dumbledore:「Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen」
Dumbledore:「But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?」
Dumbledore:「And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?」

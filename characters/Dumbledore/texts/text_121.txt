Harry:「Are you all right?」
Dumbledore:「The sensation does take some getting used to.」
Harry:「I’m fine. But I think I might prefer brooms. . . .」
Dumbledore:「This way.」
Dumbledore:「I, on the other hand, thought otherwise. Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.」
Dumbledore:「Harry?」
Harry:「And what are we doing here?」
Dumbledore:「Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you. Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.」
Dumbledore:「Not pretty, is it? Yes, something horrible has happened here.」
Dumbledore:「You mean he’s — ? Still here somewhere? Yes.」

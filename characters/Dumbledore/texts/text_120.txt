Dumbledore:「Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off. Until we meet again.」
Harry:「Bye.」
Dumbledore:「We do not want to be encumbered by these just now. I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case.」
Narrator:Harry think "Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore’s most prized possessions."
Dumbledore:「Keep your wand at the ready, Harry.」
Harry:「Why not, sir?」
Dumbledore:「You are with me. This will do, Harry.」

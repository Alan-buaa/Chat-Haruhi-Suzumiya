Harry:「Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail’s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt. It woke me up, it hurt so badly.」
Dumbledore:「I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?」
Harry:「No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer?」
Dumbledore:「You are not Sirius’s only correspondent. I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.」
Harry:「But . . . why?」
Dumbledore:「Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed. That is no ordinary scar.」

Harry:「It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —」
Harry:「They had lost . . . for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.」

Ron:「Dumbledore was really angry, I’ve never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away. . . . He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We heard him —」
Ron:「Then he magicked you onto a stretcher」
Ron:「And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were . . .」
Harry:「Did someone get my Nimbus?」
Hermione:「And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.」
Harry:「The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.」

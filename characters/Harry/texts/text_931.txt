:Harry, Ron, Hermioneaction
Harry:「pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in Knockturn Alley」
Hermione:「Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry. But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?」
Ron:「Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory. Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?」
Harry:「But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’? That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.」
Harry:「Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?」
Harry:「He’s been branded with the Dark Mark.」
Harry:「He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see. Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!」
Ginny:「I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now. There’s a lot of Phlegm around.」
Harry:「I’ll be careful not to slip in it.」

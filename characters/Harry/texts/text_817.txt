Harry:「“What’s happened, Dobby?” Harry asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself.」
Dobby:「“Harry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .” Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized that too.」
Harry:「“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?” But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly.」
Harry:「What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?」
Hermione:「Harry, come on!」
Harry:「Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no! And I forbid you to hurt yourself!」

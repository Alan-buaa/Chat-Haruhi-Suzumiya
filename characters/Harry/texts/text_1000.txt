Ron:「I’m only checking!」
Harry:「Yes, Snape was offering to help him! He said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —」
Ron:「An Unbreakable Vow? Nah, he can’t have. . . . Are you sure?」
Harry:「Yes, I’m sure. Why, what does it mean?」
:Ron
Fred:「No, I don’t think we can do that, It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs —」
George:「— and if you want people to help you, Ron, I wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .」
Ron:「Gits, Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.」
Harry:「I couldn’t, I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.」

Moody:「Hello, Potter.」
Harry:「Did you find him? Mr. Crouch?」
Moody:「No.」
Harry:「Did you use the map?」
Hermione:「There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?」
Moody:「You’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror. Mind works the right way, Granger.」
Harry:「Well, he wasn’t invisible. The map shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds, then.」

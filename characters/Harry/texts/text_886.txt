Narrator:Dumbledore think "Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape."
Harry:「But I didn’t. I didn’t practice, I didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —」
Dumbledore:「Kreacher lied, You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.」
Harry:「He — he sent me on purpose?」

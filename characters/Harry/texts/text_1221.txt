Phineas Nigellus:「Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?」
Harry:「Never mind where we are.」
Phineas Nigellus:「Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?」
Harry:「Maybe, We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of Gryffindor.」
Phineas Nigellus:「Who else is here? Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!」
Harry:「They weren’t thieving. That sword isn’t Snape’s.」
Phineas Nigellus:「Where am I? Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?」
Harry:「How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?」
Harry:「Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!」
Harry:「Don’t call Hermione simple.」

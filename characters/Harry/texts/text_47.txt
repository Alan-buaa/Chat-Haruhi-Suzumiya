Harry:「Neville, you can look!」
Ron:「It was Snape, Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.」
Hagrid:「Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?」
Harry:「I found out something about him, He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.」
Hermione:「So why did he just try and kill Harry?」
Hagrid:「I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong! I don’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel —」
Harry:「Aha! so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?」

Ron:「Want to play chess, Harry?」
Harry:「No.」
Ron:「Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?」
Harry:「No . . . you go . . .」
Ron:「I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?」
Ron:「You sound like Hermione.」
Ron:「I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.」
Harry:「So — back again, Harry?」
Dumbledore:「So, you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.」
Harry:「I didn’t know it was called that, sir.」
Dumbledore:「And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.」
Harry:「How did you know — ?」
Harry:「It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . .」
Dumbledore:「Obviously, you’ve just done so. You may ask me one more thing, however.」
Harry:「What do you see when you look in the mirror?」

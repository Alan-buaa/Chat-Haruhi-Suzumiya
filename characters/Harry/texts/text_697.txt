Hermione:「Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?」
Harry:「Just you and Ron, yeah?」
Hermione:「Well, well . . . now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t be pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to other people.」
Harry:「Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter, remember?」
Hermione:「Because, I don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.」
Harry:「There was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?」

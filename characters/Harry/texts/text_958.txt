Narrator:Dumbledore think "I think you are forgetting that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years."
Harry:「Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?」
Harry:「The Imperius Curse? Or a love potion?」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage."
Harry:「Merope? She . . . she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?」
Harry:「But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.」

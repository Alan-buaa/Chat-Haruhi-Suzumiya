Hermione:「Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?」
Harry:「Yes, I have! And so have you, Harry!」
Hermione:「When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .」
Harry:「No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him! Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!」
Harry:「Oh, come on, you can’t get round this one!」

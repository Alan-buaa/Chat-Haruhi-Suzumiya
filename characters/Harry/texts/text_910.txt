Dumbledore:「You’re like Ron, Both of you look as though you’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?」
Harry:「Yeah, I am.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.」
Harry:「So Hermione’s here?」
Harry:「Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.」
Harry:「That’s great!」

Moody:「That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter.」
Harry:「Sit down.」
Narrator:Harry think "looking around. He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror."
Harry:「What’s that?」
Moody:「Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my trunk.」
Moody:「So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?」
Harry:「It’s all right. Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.」
Moody:「So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon yet?」
Harry:「No.」

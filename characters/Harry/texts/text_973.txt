Ron:「I — I dunno, Harry, Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?」
Harry:「She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself —」
Professor McGonagall:「Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s that you’re holding, Potter?」
Harry:「It’s the thing she touched.」

Harry:「No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn’t have it with him. But that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace —」

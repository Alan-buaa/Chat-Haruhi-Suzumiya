Harry:「I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.」
Ron:「’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.」
Harry:「They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.」
Ron:「Yeah, I do! Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?」
Harry:「They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.」

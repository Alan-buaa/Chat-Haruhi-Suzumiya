Hermione:「just forget about Malfoy」
Harry:「thwarted in attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn」
Hermione:「taking Ministry of Magic tests that very afternoon」
Ron:「relaxing after realizing the girl is not Lavender」
Girl:「I was asked to give you this」
Harry:「Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!」
Hermione:「He’s mental! That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!」
Hermione:「He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught」
Harry:「We’ve been down to see him by night before」
Hermione:「Harry, you can’t be thinking of going. It’s such a pointless thing to get detention for」
Harry:「I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us」
Hermione:「Felix Felicis?」
Harry:「I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. . . .」

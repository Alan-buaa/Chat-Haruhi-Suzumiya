Lupin:「I don’t want to hear explanations. I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it’s a map. I don’t want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.」
Harry:「Why did Snape think I’d got it from the manufacturers?」
Lupin:「Because . . . , because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.」
Harry:「Do you know them?」
Ron:「It’s my fault. I persuaded you to go. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done it —」
Hermione:「Come to have a good gloat? Or have you just been to tell on us?」
Hermione:「No, I just thought you ought to know . . . Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.」
Hermione:「He — he sent me this,」
Harry:「They can’t do this, They can’t. Buckbeak isn’t dangerous.」

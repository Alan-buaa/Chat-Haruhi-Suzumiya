Narrator:Dumbledore think "I guessed, fifteen years ago, when I saw the scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort."
Harry:「You’ve told me this before, Professor,」
Dumbledore:「Yes,」
Harry:「And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort’s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.」
Harry:「Yeah, Snape told me.」

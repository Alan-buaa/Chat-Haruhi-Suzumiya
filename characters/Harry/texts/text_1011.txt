Dumbledore:「It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support —」
Harry:「After everything Fudge did last year? After Umbridge?」
Dumbledore:「I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —」
Harry:「So that’s why you argued! It was in the Daily Prophet.」
Dumbledore:「How very rude of him.」
Harry:「I told him I was.」
Dumbledore:「Yes, he is very nosy about that. He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.」
Harry:「So they still don’t know where you go?」
Dumbledore:「Professor Snape, Harry.」
Harry:「Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . . well, I followed them, actually. . . .」

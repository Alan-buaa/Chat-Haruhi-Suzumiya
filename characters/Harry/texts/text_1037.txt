Dumbledore:「But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?」
Harry:「Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.」
Dumbledore:「I see」
Dumbledore:「And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?」

Harry:「I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him.」

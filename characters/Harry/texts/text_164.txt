Hermione:「“How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?” Ron asked dully.」
Harry:「“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said Harry miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn’t have got his award.”」
Ron:「“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?”」
Hermione:「“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said Hermione.」
Harry:「“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I don’t blame him for wanting to stay here. . . .”」
Hermione:「“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?”」
Ron:「“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “‘Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?’”」
Harry:「they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack」

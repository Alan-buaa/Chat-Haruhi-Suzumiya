Ron:「Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious. She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.」
Harry:「Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember? Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . .」
Ron:「You couldn’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you’re the Captain!」
Harry:「I want to know what he’s up to. And don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape —」
Ron:「I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?」
Harry:「I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?」

Dumbledore:「Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry, Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —」
Harry:「DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!」
Harry:「What about Snape? You’re not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual —」
Dumbledore:「Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him」
Harry:「Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons! He threw me out of his office!」
Dumbledore:「I trust Severus Snape, but I forgot — another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father — I was wrong.」
Harry:「But that’s okay, is it? It’s okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?」

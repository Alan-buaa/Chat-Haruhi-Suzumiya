Narrator:Ron think "I did it — well, kind of! I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!"
Harry:「Good one. How’d you do, Hermione?」
Narrator:Ron think "Oh, she was perfect, obviously. Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon —"
Hermione:「And what about you? Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?」
Harry:「Yep. And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!」
Narrator:Ron think "If you ask me, she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry."
Hermione:「It’s a bit odd. She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even here?」
Harry:「I had a thought, You don’t think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?」

Harry:「Oh, hello, Harry, Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?」
Luna:「Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .」
Hermione:「Oh yes, thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . .」
Luna:「She’s a bit upset, I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, they’ve had a row.」
Luna:「Oh, it’s been all right, a bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —」
Harry:「How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?」

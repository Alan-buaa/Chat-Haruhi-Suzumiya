:Ronturned, speechless, to Harry
Harry:「D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s definitely not in the students’ cupboard. What’re we going to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I don’t know if this is a good idea. . . .」
:Hermioneshut the book with a snap
Hermione:「Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine, I don’t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in —」
Ron:「I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be persuading us to break rules. All right, we’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?」
Harry:「How long will it take to make, anyway? Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days . . . I’d say it’d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.」

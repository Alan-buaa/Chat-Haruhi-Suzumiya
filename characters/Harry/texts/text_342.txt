Ron:「Yeah, yeah, all right」
Harry:「Shut up, Pig」
Ron:「Because he’s being stupid. Its proper name is Pigwidgeon. Ginny named him. She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.」
Harry:「Where’s Crookshanks?」
Ron:「I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.」
Hermione:「Have you had a good summer, Harry? Did you get our food parcels and everything?」
Harry:「Yeah, thanks a lot. They saved my life, those cakes.」

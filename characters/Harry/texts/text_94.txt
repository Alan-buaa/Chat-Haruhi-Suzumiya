:RonPut your foot down, Fred! yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.
Harry:「See you next summer!」
:Weasleysroared with laughter
Harry:「Let Hedwig out, She can fly behind us. She hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.」
Ron:「So — what’s the story, Harry? What’s been happening?」
Harry:「told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.」
Harry:「I don’t think he could, I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.」
Fred:「Well, put it this way — house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can’t usually use it without their master’s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone’s idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?」
Harry:「Yes, Draco Malfoy. He hates me.」

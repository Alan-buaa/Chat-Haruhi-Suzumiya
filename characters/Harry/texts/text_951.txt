Dumbledore:「So, Harry, You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?」
Harry:「Yes, sir.」
Dumbledore:「Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.」
Harry:「You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything. Sir.」
Dumbledore:「Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.」
Harry:「Sir, does what you’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?」
Harry:「Where are we going, sir?」

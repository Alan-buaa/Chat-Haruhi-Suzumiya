Narrator:Neville think "Help me!"
Seamus Finnigan:「have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s been sighted.」
Harry:「Where?」
Ron:「Not too far from here . . .」
Malfoy:「What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?」
Malfoy:「Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?」
Harry:「Yeah, that’s right.」
Malfoy:「Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck. Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.」
Harry:「What are you talking about, Malfoy?」

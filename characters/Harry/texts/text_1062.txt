Narrator:Hagrid think "Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before! It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . ."
Harry:「Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.」
Hagrid:「Not in trouble, are yeh? Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —」
Harry:「No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too. He’s gone to change into something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .」

Harry:「There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave —」
Mr. Weasley:「It’s all right, Mr. Weasley, I already know.」
Harry:「You know? How could you know?」
Harry:「No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going on.」
Mr. Weasley:「Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think, and I’m obviously pleased that you’re not scared, but —」
Mrs. Weasley:「Arthur, what are you doing? It’s about to go!」
Mr. Weasley:「He’s coming, Molly!」
Mr. Weasley:「Listen, I want you to give me your word —」
Harry:「— that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?」
Mr. Weasley:「Promise me, Harry, that whatever happens —」
Harry:「Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?」
Harry:「I need to talk to you in private,」
Harry:「Who d’you reckon he is?」

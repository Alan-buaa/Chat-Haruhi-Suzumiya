Ron:「What’re we going to do today, then?」
Harry:「We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet.」
Ron:「Okay, just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.」
Hermione:「I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet! Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?」
Ron:「What is it with her?」
Harry:「It’s your friend . . .」

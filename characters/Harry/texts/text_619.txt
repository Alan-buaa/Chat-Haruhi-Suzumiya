:Mr. Weasleygripped Harry’s shoulder in warning
Harry:「Yeah, yeah, I’m good at escaping . . .」
Lucius Malfoy:「And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?」
Mr. Weasley:「I work here.」
Lucius Malfoy:「Not here, surely? I thought you were up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?」
Mr. Weasley:「No.」
Harry:「What are you doing here anyway?」
Harry:「Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to do together? What was he doing down here?」
Mr. Weasley:「Gold, I expect, Malfoy’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years, Gets him in with the right people, then he can ask favors, delay laws he doesn’t want passed, Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy.」
Harry:「Mr. Weasley, if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?」

Narrator:Harry think "Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron."
Ron:「an admiring whoop」
Harry:「Give it here, or I’ll knock you off that broom!」
Malfoy:「Oh, yeah?」
Harry:「No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy」
Malfoy:「Catch it if you can, then!」
Harry:「HARRY POTTER!」
Professor McGonagall:「Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — — how dare you — might have broken your neck —」
Professor McGonagall:「It wasn’t his fault, Professor —」
Parvati Patil:「Be quiet, Miss Patil —」
Ron:「But Malfoy —」

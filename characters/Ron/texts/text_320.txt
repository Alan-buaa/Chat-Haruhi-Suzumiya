Narrator:Harry think "By the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?"
Ron:「I don’t reckon it can be done, There’s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.」
Hermione:「There must be something, They’d never have set a task that was undoable.」
Ron:「Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.」
Harry:「An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.」
Ron:「Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!」

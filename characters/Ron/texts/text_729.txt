Hermione:「Let’s just leave! Disapparate now! We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!」
Ron:「Great idea」
Harry:「You sent Dobby.」
barman:「nodded and looked around for the elf」
Harry:「He’s dead, Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.」
barman:「I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.」
Harry:「You’re Aberforth.」
Aberforth:「neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire」
Harry:「How did you get this?」
Aberforth:「Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago. Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.」
Ron:「The silver doe! Was that you too?」
Ron:「Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!」

Hermione:「Maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here.」
Ron:「What d’you mean, draw attention to it? How could we not notice?」
Angelina:「Hi, Angelina.」
Harry:「Hi, good summer? Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.」
Harry:「Nice one.」
Angelina:「Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new person’ll fit in.」
Harry:「Okay.」
Hermione:「I’d forgotten Wood had left. I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?」
Ron:「I s’pose. He was a good Keeper . . . Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?」
Hermione:「Nothing.」
Ron:「Look at today! History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . .」

Ron:「It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate」
Neville:「I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you」
Harry:「Look,」

Luna:「Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?」
Harry:「I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then —」
Michael Corner:「You’re going to leave us in this mess?」
Ron:「No! What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who —」

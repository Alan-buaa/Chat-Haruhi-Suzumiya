Angelina:「Come on now, Ron,」
Ron:「Sorry!」
Angelina:「Get back in position, she’s fine! But as you’re passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t you? We’ve got Bludgers for that!」

Angelina:「All right, Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.」
George:「He’s just nervous,」
Fred:「Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,」
Angelina:「Stop — stop — STOP! Ron — you’re not covering your middle post!」
Harry:「Oh . . . sorry . . .」
Angelina:「You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers! Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!」
Ron:「Sorry . . .」

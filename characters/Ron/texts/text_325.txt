Hermione:「Yes, he sacked her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled —」
Ron:「Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!」
Sirius:「She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.」
Sirius:「All these absences of Barty Crouch’s . . . he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.」
Harry:「D’you know Crouch, then?」
Sirius:「Oh I know Crouch all right. He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.」
Ron:「You’re kidding!」

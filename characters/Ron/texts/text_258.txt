Ron:「Harry!」
Professor Trelawney:「I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn」
Harry:「Born under — what, sorry?」

Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in life . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?」
Harry:「No, I was born in July.」

Professor Trelawney:「It is Uranus, my dear」
Ron:「Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?」
Ron:「Miserable old bat」

Narrator:Harry think "Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?"
Ron:「I’m glad we came to get you, anyway. I was getting really worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol’s fault at first —」
Harry:「Who’s Errol?」
Fred:「Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes —」
Ron:「Who?」
Fred:「So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?」
Ron:「Er, no, he had to work tonight. Hopefully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.」

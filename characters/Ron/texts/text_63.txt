Harry:「What happened?」
Ron:「The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office — and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up —」

George:「We’re a little way outside the village, Ottery St. Catchpole.」
Fred:「Touchdown!」
Harry:「It’s not much.」
Ron:「It’s wonderful.」

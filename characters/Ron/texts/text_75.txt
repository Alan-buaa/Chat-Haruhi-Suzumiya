Narrator:Harry think "Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn’t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?"
Ron:「Can’t be much further, can it? Ready for another check on the train?」
Ron:「It’s probably just tired. It’s never been this far before.」
Harry:「There! Straight ahead!」
Ron:「Come on, nearly there, come on —」
Harry:「WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!」
Harry:「Are you okay?」
Ron:「My wand, Look at my wand —」
Harry:「Reverse!」
Ron:「That was close. Well done, car —」

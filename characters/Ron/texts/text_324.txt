Harry:「Loads of people, Some Bulgarian ministers . . . Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .」
Ron:「The Malfoys! I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!」
Sirius:「Anyone else?」
Harry:「No one,」
Sirius:「Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,」
Hermione:「I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps, What’s he like?」
Harry:「He’s okay, He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.」
Sirius:「Does he, now? I wonder why he’d do that?」
Hermione:「We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared, Remember?」
Ron:「Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he? The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.」
Hermione:「It’s more likely he did it than Winky,」
Ron:「Told you, told you she’s obsessed with house —」
